- **Development**: Continuous integration testing on `dev` branch and pull requests

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production branch (protected, auto-deploys to GitHub Pages)
- `dev` - Development branch (protected, CI testing)
- Feature branches - Merge into `dev` first, then `dev` ‚Üí `main`

### Workflow Details

**Development Workflow** (`.github/workflows/dev.yml`):

- Triggers on push/PR to `dev` branch
- Runs on Node.js 18.x and 20.x matrices
- Executes: lint ‚Üí type-check ‚Üí test ‚Üí build
- Uploads build artifacts for 7 days
- Posts PR status comments

**Production Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):

- Triggers on push to `main` branch
- Full CI pipeline: lint ‚Üí type-check ‚Üí test ‚Üí build ‚Üí deploy
- Automatic GitHub Pages deployment
- Creates versioned releases
- Zero-downtime deployment

### Manual Deployment

```bash
